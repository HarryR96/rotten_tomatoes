## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python version 3.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

The motivation behind undertaking this project was to understand contrasts in the respective behaviours of critics and regular audience members when rating movies. Using a data set of movies from the website Rotten Tomatoes, I attempted to:

1. Identify the presence of differences in the behaviour of the two groups
2. Analyse the drivers of any identified differences
3. Evaluate and compare the principal determinants of the behaviour of the two groups

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

Alongside the README, this repository contains the notebook in which the data was cleaned, analysed and visualised, and a CSV file containing the data set. The data set's columns are generally self explanatory, though a more detailed description can be found in the source linked in the acknowledgements section below.

## Interpretation and Discussion of Results <a name="results"></a>

A discussion of the results of the analysis can be found in the Medium post available here.

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements <a name="licensing"></a>

I would like to thank Kaggle user Stefano Leone for creating and sharing the data set, which can be found on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/rotten-tomatoes-movies-and-critic-reviews-dataset?select=rotten_tomatoes_movies.csv).

The Rotten Tomatoes website from which the data was sourced is also acknowledged in the description in the link.
